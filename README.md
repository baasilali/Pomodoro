# About
Henri Bergson, philosopher and Nobel prize in literature in 1927, talks about the existence of various aspects of time, assuring that only one of them produces anxiety: its dimensional aspect, which pushes us to measure it and triggers the idea of being late. However, seeing time as a succession of events (I wake up, take a shower, have breakfast, go to work etc.) doesnâ€™t generate stress.

Seeing time in a different way, as a vehicle in order to achieve something and not as something we have to reach for, reduces anxiety and this leads to a better personal effectiveness. Being more conscious of how time goes by (the 25 minutes of each pomodoro seem to go by slower) makes us achieve a greater level of concentration.
